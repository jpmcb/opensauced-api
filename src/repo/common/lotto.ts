/*
 * the following function can be used on a list of contributor counts,
 * which denote the number of contributions someone has made in a given time-frame,
 * in order to calculate the lottery factor over that time range for both the
 * individual and the broader set of contributions.
 *
 * we define the lottery factor as:
 *   > the minimum number of team members that have to suddenly disappear from a
 *   > project (they won the lottery!) before the project stalls due to lack of
 *   > knowledgeable or competent personnel.
 *
 * One way to look at this algorithm is via "equine" mathematics:
 *   > the lowest number of committers who's total contribution constitutes the
 *   > majority of the codebase
 *   > Source: https://ke4qqq.wordpress.com/2015/02/08/pony-factor-math/
 * Many call this the "pony" factor and is an adopted metric in the Apache software foundation.
 *
 * It is calculated using the following algorithm:
 *   - 1 contributor makes over 50% of commits: Very high risk
 *   - 2 contributors make over 50% of commits: High risk
 *   - 3 to 5 contributors make over 50% of commits: Moderate risk
 *   - Over 5 contributors make over 50% of commits: Low risk
 *
 * And, on an individual level, it is calculated as:
 *   - A contributor has over 50% of commits: Very high risk
 *   - A contributor has between 25-50% of commits: High risk
 *   - A contributor has between 10-25% of commits: Moderate risk
 *   - A contributor has under 10% of commits: Low risk
 *
 * There are some special edge cases this algorithm accounts for:
 *   - With no contributions where the grace period has ended, the lottery factor is very high
 *   - With no contributions but still within the grace period, the lottery factor is low
